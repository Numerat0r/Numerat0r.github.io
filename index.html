  </body> On May 28, 2016, a 3 year old boy climed into the gorrila enclosure where he was grabbed and protected by Harambe, when a zookeeper out of fear shot and killed Harambe saying he had no other choice. After that a video of the shooting and Harambe protecting the 3 year old little boy, it went viral leading to many of the memes we know and love today.     #Feelsbadman
